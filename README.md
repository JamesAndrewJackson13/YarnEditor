# How to Connect Nodes

Node connections work similar to Twine.

# Shortcut Options

Shortcut options are a new method of creating dialogue branches that does not require creating new nodes.

# How to Import Twine Files

One way to import Twine files into Yarn is to export a "Twee" file from Twine. (txt format) Open this txt file in Yarn as you would any other file.

Note: This method of importing will not preserve node locations, just each node's title, body and tags.
